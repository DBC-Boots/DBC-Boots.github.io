# Longer Term Prospects

Thanks to [this Quora thread](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-longer-term-prospects-of-graduates-of-programs-like-Dev-Bootcamp-and-App-Academy) that I'm shamelessly putting quoting here.

- Dave Hoover, Co-Founder of Dev Bootcamp

> I started programming professionally when I was 26. I got my foot in the door at a startup after teaching myself HTML and JavaScript during breaks at work and late at night after my wife and daughter were asleep. I spent the first 5 years of my career learning like a maniac.

> In 2000, I was writing simple Perl/CGI scripts. By 2005, I was working on high frequency trading applications in C++ and automotive diagnostic device software in Java. I have a humble psychology degree. For many, many software engineering jobs, degrees matter less than experience and portfolio. Which brings us to: How do you get that experience? How do you build that portfolio?

> Dev Bootcamp is basically a "foot-in-the-door as-a-service" for software developers. We launch careers. We instill a passion for the craft of software development. And if our students want to continue progressing in their career, they need to take responsibility for what happens next. If they want to steer their career toward a certain part of the tech ecosystem, they will need to take the initiative to dig deep into that domain. I did this through book groups, finding mentors, attending conferences, contributing to open source ... basically, engaging with the communities that interested me.

> For people interested in how to move from "apprentice" to "journeyman", I wrote a book on the topic: [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html).

- Magee Mooney, Hack Reactor Graduate

> Hack Reactor grad here -- I've been a programmer and have hired and managed other programmers.  My knee-jerk reaction is this:  The great bootcamps, mine among them, teach you one of the most important skills a software developer can learn -- how to learn and what credible resources exist to help you continue to develop your skills.  

> One of the top two or three responsibilities of an Engineer who aspires to developing a long-term career in this industry is the requirement that they continue to learn and, to the extent possible, learn quickly.  Don't underestimate that "meta-learning" aspect of Bootcamps.  Learn to code.  Learn how to learn to code.  

> Also while you're still a "junior" developer, pay attention to the rest of the coding ecosystem at your company.  Project Management, documentation, requirements definition and management, are important.  The more you understand about the entire software development picture and the more you do, the better your long term prospects are going to be.

> As to CS topics: do your homework in Data Structures and Algorithms.  Many professional developers haven't had a formal introduction to those two topics.  They'll do fine for a bit but, in my opinion, they'll eventually hit a wall.  You can't be a great developer without a strong understanding of both.  The good bootcamps give you a good foundation in both.  Coursera and Udacity have courses that will allow you to go in more depth.  iTunes University also hosts curricula from credible universities on these subjects.  Take them when you can.  Retake them later.  Re-retake them later still.  You're never too old or too experienced to check back in on those fundamentals.
