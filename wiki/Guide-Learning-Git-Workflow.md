# Git Workflow

[**Git Flow**](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) - An extension of git that helps for working on single features on a large project that could go into production. Credits to Vincent Driessen and his branching model linked below. [Git Flow Cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

> Start using [a more professional git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to build features and fix bugs. If you can, work with others so you can learn how to navigate conflicts. Ask mentors for advice on how to best avoid conflicts and safely merge code. Learn how to squash and amend commits, cherry-pick, create remote branches, and bisect.
