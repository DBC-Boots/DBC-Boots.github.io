* [Editing your hosts file](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/)

For OSX, your hosts file is located in the following directory:

```
/private/etc/hosts
```

Each line displays a new host. They are in the format of {host port} [SPACE] {host name}

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1 localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
```
