# Design by Contract

In [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X), Design by Contract, or DBC (not to be confused with Dev Bootcamp), discusses the importance of pre- and post-conditions.

> DBC is a software correctness methodology. It uses preconditions and postconditions to document (or programmatically assert) the change in state caused by a piece of a program.
