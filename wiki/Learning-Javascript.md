Welcome fellow Node Callbacks. Javascript has come a long way since its introduction in 1995. Node.js (and it's little side off-spring that's coming back into the Node Project, io.js) really got the ground running in making Javascript into the community favorite language (**opinion of the author**). 

# Javascript Resources

* [Joyent NodeJS Resources](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Resources)
* [Node School](http://nodeschool.io/) - "Personally recommend the starter courses. I learned piping in a day, and I got a lot out of it. Now I'm prepped to start writing Gulp plugins." -- Jeremy Wong

## AngularJS

* [Promises in AngularJS, Explained as a Cartoon](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html). [Andy Shora](https://twitter.com/andyshora) uses cartoons to demostrate how promises work in AngularJS (as well as how the $q library handles it in other JS apps).
* [Jeremy's Angular Boilerplate](https://github.com/jermspeaks/Angular-Boilerplate) - A boilerplate for creating Angular apps. In Development.

## EmberJS

* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) - Ember's command line tool much like Rails in that it will set-up the entire project for you, including the build system, testing, app serving. Much like [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/) or [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on Node.

`WIP`

## React / Flux

* [Scotch.io's React Primer Course](https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-facebooks-react-js) - Scotch.io walks you through React, Flux, and three example applications. Good for beginners to React.

"My suggestion is you go through tutorials and try to explain each concept on your own. Play with the code in your own test environment and get used to the JSX syntax."
* [On D3, React, and a little bit of Flux](https://medium.com/@sxywu/on-d3-react-and-a-little-bit-of-flux-88a226f328f3) - [Shirley Wu](https://twitter.com/shirleyxywu) walks through her 6 month React side project on Medium and some of the things she's learned while playing with React and Flux. If you're interested in utilizing D3 in a React app, this is a must read.
