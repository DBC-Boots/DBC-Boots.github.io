Welcome fellow Node Callbacks. Javascript has come a long way since its introduction in 1995. Node.js (and it's little side off-spring that's coming back into the Node Project, io.js) really got the ground running in making Javascript into the community favorite language (**opinion of the author**). 

# Javascript Resources

## ES6 or ES2015
* [An Introduction to ES6 with io.js](https://github.com/tonypujals/demo-iojs-es6/blob/master/presentation.md)
* [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org/)

## Node.js

* [NodeJS Learning](https://github.com/sergtitov/NodeJS-Learning)
* [Joyent NodeJS Resources](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Resources)
* [Node School](http://nodeschool.io/) - "Personally recommend the starter courses. I learned piping in a day, and I got a lot out of it. Now I'm prepped to start writing Gulp plugins." -- Jeremy Wong

## AngularJS

* [AngularJS Learning](https://github.com/jmcunningham/AngularJS-Learning). The motherload of all resources about AngularJS. 
* [Promises in AngularJS, Explained as a Cartoon](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html). [Andy Shora](https://twitter.com/andyshora) uses cartoons to demostrate how promises work in AngularJS (as well as how the $q library handles it in other JS apps).
* [Jeremy's Angular Boilerplate](https://github.com/jermspeaks/Angular-Boilerplate) - A boilerplate for creating Angular apps. In Development.

## EmberJS

* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) - Ember's command line tool much like Rails in that it will set-up the entire project for you, including the build system, testing, app serving. Much like [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/) or [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on Node.

## Meteor

`WIP`

## React / Flux

* [Scotch.io's React Primer Course](https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-facebooks-react-js) - Scotch.io walks you through React, Flux, and three example applications. Good for beginners to React.
* [Learning React JS](https://gist.github.com/jermspeaks/7e66b3a7515bb96fbc95) - Personal notes from [Jeremy Wong](https://twitter.com/jermspeaks) on learning React JS and Flux Architecture. "My suggestion is you go through tutorials and try to explain each concept on your own. Play with the code in your own test environment and get used to the JSX syntax."
* [On D3, React, and a little bit of Flux](https://medium.com/@sxywu/on-d3-react-and-a-little-bit-of-flux-88a226f328f3) - [Shirley Wu](https://twitter.com/shirleyxywu) walks through her 6 month React side project on Medium and some of the things she's learned while playing with React and Flux. If you're interested in utilizing D3 in a React app, this is a must read.

## Javascript Tooling

Thanks to the [Book of Modern frontend Tooling](http://tooling.github.io/book-of-modern-frontend-tooling/), I'm going to split this section into three parts: scaffolds, build systems, and dependency management. If you haven't checked out the book, it's a collaborative effort by the folks behind these projects to talk about the tooling that exists for building your Javascript project.

### Scaffolds

* Yeoman
* Brunch
* Loom

### Build Systems

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Broccoli](http://broccolijs.com/)

There are a ton more that I could put here. But as the tooling is becoming more refined, a clear winner may rise to the top. The problem with Front-end Development is many of these projects may fall out of vogue like the snap of my fingers. Think [Adobe Flash Player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/) and [Actionscript](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript.html). The jobs for Actionscript developers deminished to nearly nil. Know that this list above may very well change by 2016.

If you're interested in the next-gen build systems, watch this talk by [James Kyle](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) called ["Compiling Javascript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3AWp_-Qzs) at jQuerySF 2015. You may need an introduction to [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to understand what the implications of the next generation build tools are. Or better yet, if you only want to learn about the Javascript Syntax Tree, watch Ariya Hidayat & Mike Sherovtalk's on [Javascript Syntax Tree Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=954lRqSI_Ro).

### Dependency Management

* NPM / Browserify
* Bower
* Webpack

# Javascript Videos

* [Talks For Every Javascript Developer curated by Angelina Fabbro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLseEp7p6Ewia6RT5Ngz8yk-t-jAZvA-8N). A great playlist of Javascript videos on Youtube for anyone starting out as a Javascript developer. Goes over components of Javascript Frameworks, DNS basics, Definition of an Event Loop, Testing, Optimization, Hash Functions, and much more. If none of those topics are remotely familiar to you, watch the videos now!
* [Where Angelina Fabbro Teaches Us Things And Makes Us Laugh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLseEp7p6EwiakjMZ_fXUs3F9xfcr979v5). Another Youtube video playlist from the woman who curated the previous list. She also gives excellent talks about HTML Canvas, the Shadow DOM, SEO, and much more.
