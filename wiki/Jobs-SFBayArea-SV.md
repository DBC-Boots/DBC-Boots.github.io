## A Brief History

A hotbed of tech companies, giant and small. The history of semiconductor companies here have given its name in addition to the spirit of entrepreneurship. Growing out of the [Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_Semiconductor_Laboratory), [eight core scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) left the company due to Shockley's poor management and formed what's considered the first start-up, [Fairchild Semiconductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor). These scientists are well known throughout the field, and you'll once in a while hear one of them brought up. For example, [Gordon Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore) of `Moore's Law` fame was among one of them. [Robert Noyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce) later became the founder of [Intel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel). [Recommended below is a book called `The Innovators`](#books) dedicated to the teams that formed great companies in Silicon Valley.

The companies that have been brought up here since are a mix of notable and unremarkable. See this [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley#Notable_companies) article for the notable ones. If you have any interest in the history of the computer (and of Silicon Valley), I suggest you go to the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/) in Mountain View, which is coincidentally not too far away from the Google Campus.

## Today's Culture

`WIP`

Talk to anyone senior here today, and the echoes of the [Dot-Com Bubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) are still felt today (15 years ago now). The crazy investments of those times are gone, although talk to a few and they would say it's happening again today. None-the-less, the Venture Capital (VC) game is still crazy here where you'll find start-ups everywhere for just about everything, you'd think. Especially the start-ups that don't seem to have business plans.

## Novelizations

* [Learning Curve](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Curve-Michael-S-Malone/dp/1935460994) by Michael S. Malone.

> Get an inside view of the breathless, winner-take-all world of high technology--Silicon Valley style--in this fast-paced corporate thriller. Veteran businessman Dan Crowen is finally handed the reins of a large, successful tech firm, Validator Software--only to be ordered by its eccentric owner, Cosmo Validator, to take a step that could destroy the company. Young entrepreneur Alison Prue is at the helm of Validator's upstart rival, eTernity. When the venture capitalists funding eTernity decide it's time to take the the hot young startup public and go head-to-head against Validator, both Alison and Dan are caught up in a global tsunami of high-tech conspiracies. Nothing's as it seems in this high-stakes game of cat and mouse that will keep you guessing the whole way through.

## Books

* [Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648545) - The Biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson spent the last few years interviewing Jobs, having exclusive conversations that no one else in the press had. If you haven't read any other biographies from Isaacson, he really does his homework, trying to find all angles, while telling a compelling story. 
* [The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/147670869X) - Another book from Walter Isaacson about how innovation in the past century happened in teams, not as individual contributors. Particularly, Isaacson covers the invention of the computer and related technologies, and tries not to skimp on details. It covers the beginnings of Silicon Valley and worth a read for anyone interested in the technology we use everyday.
* [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) - I actually haven't read this book, but it says it's highly recommended on Amazon. Can someone vouch for this one? `WIP`
* [In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](http://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585) - A history of the beginnings of Google. Written by [Steven Levy](https://twitter.com/stevenlevy), it covers about the first 15 years of the company history, some of its great achievements, and where it could be headed. This book was published before [Eric Schmidt](https://twitter.com/ericschmidt) resigned as CEO.
