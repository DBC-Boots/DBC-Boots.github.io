# Negotiations

`WIP` - This section will discuss how to negotiate with your potential employers, boss, working up the corporate ladder, etc.

[Stephanie Chou](https://twitter.com/HelloJello92) gave a survey out a few months ago. It's an anonymous survey, and you should contribute to it when you land your first job. [Google Sheets Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Adve30xKqB4eFZ73IbpKQIUbAdgz2YBl0SPboIXaerE)

Here's a summary of those results as of August 13th, 2015 (self-survey, 23 data points)
