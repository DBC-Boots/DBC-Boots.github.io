* [MIT Open Courseware's Introduction to Programming in Java](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/)

## JVM

You don't learn Java without running into the JVM. This introduction fits nicely with other JVM languages such as Scala and Clojure.
