> [Wiki](Home) ▸ **Dev Interviews**

[Kevin Ko](https://twitter.com/kokev) (2013 DBC Grad) wrote an entire book on this topic, as well as hacking the job application. It's called [Hired Fast: The Junior Developer's Guide To Getting a Job](https://kokev.in/hired-fast?promo=dbcrocks). DBC grads get $10 off if they use this exclusive link. (Retail $39, Discount $29)

> This guide teaches you the techniques successful candidates have used to get companies begging them to join. Interview advice is outdated, it's not about memorizing algorithms and having a neat résumé anymore. Instead of learning how to traverse binary trees, you'll master the job interview process from start to finish and use today's techniques to get hired.
