## FAQ

### Writing a Successful Cold Email

#### Question

From the general Slack channel, [@jayquigley](https://twitter.com/jay_quig) asks, "**What are some tips from your experience for writing successful cold emails to people?**"

#### Question Details

Specifically, cold emails pertaining to job hunting.  I'm looking to make connections at the companies to which I’m applying or in which I’m most interested.

Every tip page I find online suggests I should try to ‘add value’ for the other person if possible.  In general, I’m not sure of a way to do this besides giving them the sense they’re helping someone.  Maybe that’s all I need.  Maybe I’m overthinking this.

#### Responses

From [@chrisdelauder](https://github.com/cdelauder)
> I put puppy pictures of my beagle inline. In all seriousness, it significantly increased my response rate.

From [@justaboutjeff](https://twitter.com/justaboutjeff)
> I always open my first sentence with my name and how I found their contact info. It’s a little creepy to get a message from someone who never explains themselves, or does it 2 paragraphs in. 

> Speaking of 2 paragraphs don’t do that. If I really do have a bunch of stuff to discuss, I usually ask if they’re open to talking further or answering questions over email.

> Get a quick “sure nice to meet you” response out of the way first

> And if you’re looking to talk with a hiring manager or engineering manager, I usually check to see if they’re on twitter first and send them that first “open to talking?” message via tweet. Then they can reply with their email address if you can’t locate it otherwise.

> If they have a job posting online, tell them you want to discuss it. They are motivated to hire people.

> Sending cold emails is an exercise in detachment it’s very zen buddhist. If you get a response yay. If not  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

> **TL;DR** keep it brief, introduce yourself, get to the point quickly

From [@tonyta](https://twitter.com/tonyta)
> Doing something silly like @chrisdelauder recommended totally works. It shows you to be more human. If they tweet or have an interesting github, reference that or play around with their projects. (Prob less relevant if the company is super corporate or uptight)

From [@laurenscott](https://twitter.com/devdame)
> Assume that everyone is busy but nice. Most people are. Imagine what you, as a busy but nice person, would want to hear.

> I get a fair amount of cold emails from people. The ones I’m the most enthusiastic about talking with are people who seem

> 1. genuine
> 1. focused (they have a clear idea of what they want to talk with me about), and 
> 1. not entitled

> The most off-putting thing is people who feel as if they are owed your time. Avoid that like the plague.

> Keep it brief, humble, and passionate.
