# Tips and Tricks

If you really want to start speaking, **start today**. It doesn't matter where or with who, just start talking. There's really not going to be anytime better than now. It could be in front of your family, at a bar, while doing a handstand. Okay, probably not that last one, but you get what I mean.

That said, you're probably not prepared enough yet, so the second thing is **practice**. Practice your speech at least once in front of a mirror, and once in front of someone else. Most first-time speakers have a difficult time speaking to an audience, so this exercise helps alleviate some of that stress.

## PowerPoint Alternatives
* [Deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) - One shortcoming of PowerPoint is that it's hard to share it in the browser. You have to download the presentation and open it before you can look at the slides. And that's assuming you have PowerPoint installed. Deck.js makes beautiful presentations in the browser that you can immediately share after you give the presentation.
* [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/) - Part of the Google Drive set of tools for making presentations. 
* [Prezi](https://prezi.com/) - Zoom in and out of one big presentation image. The default animation of zoom in and out makes for a different pace than PowerPoint. I'm not a personal fan of Prezi, but I do like its effort to stand out away from PowerPoint.

# Tips

**Don't write out your whole speech**. I think the most boring talk is one where someone writes out their speech on a Powerpoint and lazily reads off the slides word by word. A professor of mine did that, and I slept through most of the class. It doesn't engage the audience and if you're reading from the slide, it most likely means you're not facing the audience, unless you have a teleprompter.

**Stand Firm and Don't Fidget**. I have difficulty with this one because I like to move my hands a lot. If you're fidgeting, turn those actions into dramatic hand gestures. At least then you'll seem like you just came out of a theater performance.

**Know Your Audience**. Structure your talk for the people who are going to listen to you. If it's in front of a bunch of developers, tailor the talk to be about programming. If it's in front of VPs and Executives, dumb down the tech or use analogies. Don't dwell a lot on the details and minutiae of your code.
