# Tips and Tricks

If you really want to start speaking, **start today**. It doesn't matter where or with who, just start talking. There's really not going to be anytime better than now. It could be in front of your family, at a bar, while doing a handstand. Okay, probably not that last one, but you get what I mean.

That said, you're probably not prepared enough yet, so the second thing is **practice**. Practice your speech at least once in front of a mirror, and once in front of someone else. Most first-time speakers have a difficult time speaking to an audience, so this exercise helps alleviate some of that stress.

**Don't write out your whole speech**. I think the most boring talk is one where someone writes out their speech on a Powerpoint and lazily reads off the slides word by word. A professor of mine did that, and I slept through most of the class. It doesn't engage the audience and if you're reading from the slide, it most likely means you're not facing the audience, unless you have a teleprompter.

**Stand Firm and Don't Fidget**. I have difficulty with this one because I like to move my hands a lot. If you're fidgeting, turn those actions into dramatic hand gestures. At least then you'll seem like you just came out of a theater performance.

**Know Your Audience**. Structure your talk for the people who are going to listen to you. If it's in front of a bunch of developers, tailor the talk to be about programming. If it's in front of VPs and Executives, dumb down the tech or use analogies. Don't dwell a lot on the details and minutiae of your code.

# Resources

* [Technically Speaking](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest)) is a weekly email subscription (via Tinyletter) by [Chiu-Ki Chan](https://twitter.com/chiuki) and [Cate Huston](https://twitter.com/catehstn). The weekly newsletter highlights upcoming conference call for proposal deadlines as well as a link round-up of the week's speaking articles written by actual speakers.
* [Articles to help and motivate you](http://weareallaweso.me/). [Tiffany Conroy](https://twitter.com/theophani)'s list of collected resources for speakers. A go-to list for anyone speaking for the first time and veteran speakers. Thanks to [Lauren Scott](https://twitter.com/devdame) for the link.
* [You Don’t Need to be Social to Speak](http://femgineer.com/2015/03/you-dont-need-to-be-social-to-speak/). The Femgineer, [Poornima Vijayashanker](https://twitter.com/poornima), was the founding engineer for Mint.com. After Mint was acquired by Intuit, she founded another successful company, and now teaches entrepreneurship by writing about how to build software products from ideas. She is also an avid speaker and has many posts, like this one, to help new speakers get their feet wet with speaking.
* [Help Me Abstract](http://helpmeabstract.com/) - Submit your abstract via Github Gists and get it reviewed by a veteran speaker before submitting it to conference/meet-up organizers.
* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/). This app analyzes your writing to give you feedback on making your sentences bolder and clearer. Credits to [Oli](https://twitter.com/olitreadwell).

## PowerPoint Alternatives
* [Deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) - One shortcoming of PowerPoint is that it's hard to share it in the browser. You have to download the presentation and open it before you can look at the slides. And that's assuming you have PowerPoint installed. Deck.js makes beautiful presentations in the browser that you can immediately share after you give the presentation.
* [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/) - Part of the Google Drive set of tools for making presentations. 
* [Prezi](https://prezi.com/) - Zoom in and out of one big presentation image. The default animation of zoom in and out makes for a different pace than PowerPoint. I'm not a personal fan of Prezi, but I do like its effort to stand out away from PowerPoint.

# Conferences

This is a section dedicated to conference speaking, suggestions of conferences you should try to attend, and inspirational videos. Most of this section is thanks to [Chiu-Ki Chan](https://twitter.com/chiuki) and [Cate Huston](https://twitter.com/catehstn) who run the weekly newsletter [Technically Speaking](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak), which I talked about in the section above.

* From the Inspiration section of [Technically Speaking's August 4th, 2015 edition](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak/letters/technically-speaking-august-4-2015)

> Keila Banks gave the inspiration keynote “Undefinable Me” at OSCON. People may see her as a 13-year-old girl from inner city Los Angeles, but she is so much more than that. We love how she kept asking “Have you redefined me yet?” throughout her talk. Public speaking is great for that: To change discourse by challenging stereotypes. African American means uneducated? Girl means not techy? Not so fast. [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkTcSoQ-q5Q), [tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Watch%20Keila%20Banks%27%20inspirational%20keynote%20%22Undefinable%20Me%22%20http://bit.ly/1MxJfpC%20via%20%40techspeakdigest).
