# Guide for All Developers

[Ken Shimizu](https://twitter.com/vice_versus_) wrote this in his piece you can find over at [Jobs Success Stories](Jobs-Success-Stories) that explains the amount you just don't know still coming out of DBC.

> When I first started working, there were so many factors around writing code that I didn’t know, that it was hard for me to focus on coding itself. Learning the domain model, estimation, design collaboration, git flow, and a deployment process, all while trying to show your technical worth can be hard. It took me months to learn all these little skills, but if you can learn some of them before entering the workforce, you can really hit the ground running! Not only that, but you’ll be able to talk about them knowledgeably at an interview, improving your chances of getting hired.

## Continual Learning

Learning doesn't stop at DBC. Here's some more topics to start tackling for your software career.

### Reading

* [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) - If you didn't read this before or during your DBC experience, you should read this book. It goes through a slew of things you did at DBC like refactoring, testing, DRY, and debugging, but it also has things on estimation, design by contract, and power editing. Basically, it's not a book you read once. You return back to it after working and start to write programs differently after you've worked on a few projects.
* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/) - Microsoft's book on writing clean code, over a decade old. Recommended by most programmers I've met.
* [Coders At Work](http://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483) - Interviews with successful programmers. From the same series as *[Founders At Work](#founders-at-work)*

#### Technology World

I don't know where to put there (ever-growing) list of books I have about technology. They really might not be pertinent to the world of being a developer, but none-the-less, I read too many books to count anyways.

* [The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book That Will Change the Way You Do Business](http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business/dp/0062060244)
* [Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal](http://www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591847087)
* [The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219282)

##### Entrepreneurship

* <a id="founders-at-work"></a>[Founders At Work](http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788) - Jessica Levingston interviews start-up entrepreneurs who grew their companies big. More about business in tech than in the technical details.

##### Start-ups

* [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) - Eric Ries describes his failed startup and what he has learned from advising other startups and watch them grow. He's working on a new book now, funded by backers on Kickstarter, so you should [check it out](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/881308232/only-on-kickstarter-the-leaders-guide-by-eric-ries).
* [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) - Based on Peter Thiel's Stanford course and notes, the book goes through some trends Thiel has seen in the start-ups he invests in.
