## Choosing A Destination

A very common question post DBC grads ask is where they can move to and pick up work. Here's a [DBC Facebook page thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devbootcamp/permalink/1006850289335933/) concerning this issue.

Pamela Guerrero asks,

> Hello everyone! 
> I am almost done with DBC here in Chicago , and I want to move preferably to Denver, but my other options are Portland, Seattle and Austin. 
> Does any of you have any advice of which of this places have the most opportunities?
> Thank you all!!!

Celeen Rusk replies

> I'm not sure which location has more opportunities; but they all probably have some opportunities. If I were in your shoes, I'd pick my favorite city, the place I'd most want to live, and focus on those opportunities.

Charles Green replies

> NYC and SF have the most jobs by far, but I have friends in tech jobs and have heard plenty of good things about Portland, Seattle, Austin, Asheville NC, and LA.

Ryan Rebo replies

> I live and work in portland and love it. There seem to be quite a few jobs for devs here

Nichole Shelton replies

> Seattle has a TON of jobs

Jair Moreno replies

> Austin has tons of jobs and cost of living is not that bad, Dallas is a good option too. A good condo is like 900 a month.

Jess Unrein replies

> I know that there have been several DBC hires in the Denver area. I would reach out to Lia and Jill to see what connections you can make. Also, I think Christoph Prater got a job in Denver after graduation.

Vincent Colavin replies

> As others have said, there are opportunities in every major city. Some places (NYC, SF, SEA) have more than others. My post-DBC strategy was to just pick a city I liked and find a job there. Being a web developer is amazing for that reason!

> I live in Portland and I can give my personal recommendation for it. It's got fairly small but active and fun tech scene! smile emoticon

Nate Beers replies

> I went to Miami because I wanted to stay somewhere warm. It doesn't matter which city you pick, it will have jobs. But I guess do some basic research on indeed and other sites to look for the specific language you want to work in.
