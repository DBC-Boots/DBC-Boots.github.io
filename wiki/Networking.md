## Managing Connections

A.k.a "The Hustle". It's the art of really making meaningful connections with the people you meet. There's a few rules about managing your connections though, so let's go over some ground rules.

* **Be genuinely interested in the person**. It does you no good if you're not interested in talking to this person. Don't feel bad when you stop talking to this new connection. It was never meant to be.
* **Be friends with your connection**. The best way to really get to know someone is to actually be their friend. While in a sales engineering class, the class had a speaker come in to talk about his sales experience of creating large contracts for his company. He says it's not enough to just be their work colleague; you have to be friends with them. That means doing what friends do. Being honest, trusting one another. At some point, you forget about the boundary between connection and friend because they mean the same thing.
* **Don't spam the connection**, which could also be *treat those how you would like to be treated*. Except that second saying seems cliche and biblical, and we're trying to keep it secular here. Joking aside, the old adage is true, especially in this day and age. If you don't like what your connection said, you can politely tell them, and not barrage them with your own agenda.
* **You don't have to be connected to someone you don't like**. The nice thing about connections are that you don't have to connect with those you don't feel like being a connection with. Feel like that guy's a dick? You shouldn't suck up to him if you don't want to. You have a choice to introduce people in your life. On that same tangent, you also have the power to stop being someone's connection. If things aren't going the way you thought they would, either shy away from that relationship or tell them directly. You're responsible for being in that connected relationship.
* **Take the effort to really get to know this connection**. When you make this connection personal, and listen to what they say, it makes a huge difference. When you can mirror what they tell you, but with different words, it feels to them like they're being heard. Hopefully, that works both ways.

## Resources

### Books

* [How to Win Friends & Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) - The old Dale Carnegie classic. Still very applicable today as it was over half a century ago. Most seem very common sense, and it is, but worth re-visiting time and again.
