# Upgrading Your Terminal

* [The Art of the Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - One of the best guides out there for learning your command line like the back of your hand. No really, if you think you're great with the command line now, think again. Points you in the direction of what you should learn, but not so great in actually teaching it.

## Bash

`WIP`

* [Bash Autocomplete for Git](http://code-worrier.com/blog/autocomplete-git/)

## ZSH

`WIP`

* [Oh-my-zsh]()
* [Pretzo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - A more lightweight OMZ (Thanks to [Stefano](https://twitter.com/stefanoschiavi)). [The difference between OMZ and Pretzo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/611).

## Fish

## Vim

At some point, you're going to `ssh` into something, whether it be a virtual machine, a remote server, whatever. And when you want to edit a file, you're going to open up vim. Might as well make it look the way you would in a typical text editor. 

* [Turn on and off syntax](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/turn-on-or-off-color-syntax-highlighting-in-vi-or-vim/) via `~/.vimrc`
* [**Vundle**](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) - Package manager for Vim
