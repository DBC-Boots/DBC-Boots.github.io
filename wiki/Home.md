## Introduction

Perhaps the excitement of graduation has finally waned and it's time to actually look for a job. Perhaps it's the angst of not having a job because your financial runway is about to crap out. Perhaps it's a lack of direction because you want to do and learn everything. This guide is written in a way to help you navigate through your excitement or fears of the next steps. 

Many responses online may seem a negative about their experiences post-Dev Bootcamp, being left unprepared or feeling as though the job market isn't hiring. News flash, you're hirable, you just need to put yourself out there and really market yourself, which can be really challenging. 

Or maybe you've had that first, bad experience outside of Dev Bootcamp and you're re-considering your options. We don't claim to have all of the answers, but if you browse around here long enough, you might be able to answer your own questions. The big take-away is, after Dev Bootcamp (or anytime in life for that matter), you never stop learning. Remember. You can talk about doing something. You can do something. Or you can do both.

## Contribution Guide

Looking at very well documented Github Wikis, for example [Snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki) and [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki) from [this Quora thread](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-very-well-made-GitHub-wiki-pages-for-open-source-projects), the pages are name-spaced corresponding to its section.

### Edit Message

Personally haven't been too good about it. Make it short and to the point if you're editing someone else's sentences.

> @channel: spitballin’ ideas here, but have we thought about creating a github repo from DBC alums for DBC alums, which talks about different categories relevant to devs post-graduation? Or has this already been done?

> Topics of interest: Hiring, Speaking, Organising Meetups, Dev Interviews, Networking, Mentee & Mentors.

> I imagine it’d start out really loosely and then as it grows it can move around and be re-structured. It seems like there’s a lot of space here for a publicly created "DBC alum accredited” resource like this to bring more people into the DBC fold and also help everyone.

Hence this Github organization was born. [Jeremy Wong](https://twitter.com/jermspeaks) has been the prime editor of this Wiki. [Kelly Yamamoto](https://twitter.com/minedamnesia) suggests us to follow the organization's [[Code of Conduct]].
