# Technical Debt

One of the most important ideas when working on a project is the idea of `technical debt`. When you start coding on a project, you make decisions at certain points that will incur some revisiting at a later point in time. If you don't take the time after coding a certain feature, or before the code goes into production, and address these things, whether it be to optimize an algorithm that's slowing down a system, or writing a necessary test you skipped over, you pay the consequences, sometimes severely, later on.
