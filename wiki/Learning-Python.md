# Python Resources 

This is a collection of useful resources that [Stefano](https://github.com/stefanosc) put together to learn Python as a developer.

*   David Goodger's [Code Like a Pythonista](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/presentation.html)
*   [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
*   Python.org [Beginners guide to Python for programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)  
     lots of cool resources on this page; after a first glance these seems very interesting:  

    *   [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?csw=1)
    *   [Instant Python (a minimal crash-course)](http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html)

     a simple book to learn Python, for programmers who are new to Python
*   [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)  
     another interesting python book for "experienced programmers"
*   [Python Quick Reference](http://rgruet.free.fr/)  
     a (relatively) Quick Reference for Python in a single long HTML page
*   [Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)  
     seems like an interesting read from [Mindviewinc](http://www.mindviewinc.com)
*   Tutorials Point [Python Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
*   The Official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/index.html)  
     This might be a bit too verbose..

### From [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/best-python-resources.html)

#### New to programming

If you're learning your first programming language these books were written with you in mind. Developers learning Python as a second or later language should skip down to the next section for "experienced developers".

* To get an introduction to Python, Django and Flask at the same time, consider purchasing the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/?utm_source=fsp&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=bestresources) course by Fletcher, Michael and Jeremy.
* This [short 5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvK0UzFNw1Q) explains why it's better to think of projects you'd like to build and problems you want to solve with programming. Start working on those projects and problems rather than jumping into a specific language that's recommended to you by a friend.
* If you've never programmed before check out the [Getting Started](http://learntocodewith.me/getting-started/) page on [Learn To Code with Me](http://learntocodewith.me/) by [Laurence Bradford](https://twitter.com/lebdev). She's done an incredible job of breaking down the steps beginners should take when they're uncertain about where to begin.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) is a free book by Zed Shaw.
* [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/) is an open source book provided under the Creative Commons license and available in HTML or PDF form.
* [Python for You and Me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (pym) is an online book for people completely unfamiliar with the Python programming language.
* While not Python-specific, Mozilla put together a [Learning the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn) tutorial for beginners and intermediate web users who want to build websites. It's worth a look from a general web development perspective.
* [A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/) is a beginner's tutorial for the Python language.
* Code Academy has a [Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) for people completely new to programming.
* [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html) goes over the basic syntax and control structures in Python. The free book has numerous code examples to go along with each topic.
* Google put together a great compilation of materials and subjects you should read and learn from if you want to be a [professional programmer](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html). Those resources are useful not only for Python beginners but any developer who wants to have a strong professional career in software.
* The O'Reilly book [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) is available in HTML form for free on the web.
* [Python Practice Book](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html) is a book of Python exercises to help you learn the basic language syntax.
* Looking for ideas about what projects to use to learn to code? Check out [this list of 5 programming project for Python beginners](https://medium.com/learning-journalism-tech/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner-21492f6ce0f3).
* I wrote a quick blog post on [learning Python](http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html) that non-technical folks trying to learn to program may find useful.

#### Experienced developers new to Python

* [Learn Python in y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) provides a whirlwind tour of the Python language. The guide is especially useful if you're coming in with previous software development experience and want to quickly grasp how the language is structured.
* [Python for you and me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is an approachable book with sections for Python syntax and the major language constructs. The book also contains a short guide at the end to get programmers to write their first Flask web application.
* Kenneth Reitz's [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) contains a wealth of information both on the Python programming language and the community.
* [How to Develop Quality Python Code](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/how-to-develop-quality-python-code) is a good read to begin learning about development environments, application dependencies and project structure.

#### Beyond the basics
* [The Python Ecosystem: An Introduction](http://mirnazim.org/writings/python-ecosystem-introduction/) provides context for virtual machines, Python packaging, pip, virutalenv and many other topics after learning the basic Python syntax.
* The [Python Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/python) rolls up great Python links and has an active community ready to answer questions from beginners and advanced Python developers alike.
* [Good to Great Python Reads](http://jessenoller.com/good-to-great-python-reads/) is a collection of intermediate and advanced Python articles around the web focused on nuances and details of the Python language itself.
* The blog [Free Python Tips](http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/) provides posts on Python topics as well as news for the Python ecosystem.
* [Python Books](http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/) is a collection of freely available books on Python, Django, and data analysis.
* [Python IAQ: Infrequently Asked Questions](http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html) is a list of quirky queries on rare Python features and why certain syntax was or was not built into the language.

#### Videos, screencasts and presentations

* Videos from conferences and meetups along with screencasts are listed on the [best Python videos page](http://www.fullstackpython.com/best-python-videos.html).

#### Curated Python packages lists

* [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) is an incredible list of Python frameworks, libraries and software. I wish I had this page when I was just getting started.
* [easy-python](http://easy-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is like awesome-python although instead of just a Git repository this site is in the Read the Docs format.

#### Newsletters

* [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/) is a free weekly roundup of the latest Python articles, videos, projects and upcoming events.
* [PyCoder's Weekly](http://pycoders.com/) is another great free weekly email newsletter similar to Python Weekly. The best resources are generally covered in both newsletters but they often cover different articles and projects from around the web.
* [Import Python](http://importpython.com/newsletter/) is a newer newsletter thank Python Weekly and PyCoder's Weekly. So far I've found this newsletter covers different sources from other newsletters. It's well worth subscribing to all three so you don't miss anything.
