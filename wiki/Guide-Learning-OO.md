## Object Interfaces

From [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2866987/what-is-the-definition-of-interface-in-object-oriented-programming):

> It is actually a concept of abstraction and encapsulation. For a given "box", it declares the "inputs" and "outputs" of that box. In the world of software, that usually means the operations that can be invoked on the box (along with arguments) and in some cases the return types of these operations.

> What it does not do is that it does not define what the semantics of these operations are, although it is commonplace (and very good practice) to document them in proximity to the declaration (e.g., via comments), or to pick good naming conventions. Nevertheless, there are no guarantees that these intentions would be followed.
