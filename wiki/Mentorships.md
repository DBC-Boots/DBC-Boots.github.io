* Our very own [Dave Hoover](https://twitter.com/davehoover), along with [Adewale Oshineye](https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye), wrote the book, [Apprenticeships Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do). The book is full of tips on learning from a mentor.
* [Code Newbie Podcast Ep. 34 Newbie Story: LaToya Allen](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/newbie-story-latoya-allen). LaToya talks about her experience being a mentee at 8th Light from having no coding experience, then moving on starting a job at Avant.
