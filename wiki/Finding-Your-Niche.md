# Job Positions

Here is a list of job positions and a deep dive into each role.

## Front-end Developer

* [A Baseline for Front-End Engineers](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/), by Rebecca Murphey, her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmurphey) and [Github](https://github.com/rmurphey). Updated [2015 Version](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers-2015/). An absolute must-read for anyone looking for a job as a front-end engineer. In-depth post about the tools you should be using (or looking into).
* [The Two Pillars of Javascript, Part 1](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3) & [Part 2: Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4). Eric Elliott writes about what every Javascript developer should know: Prototypal Inheritance (objects without classes) and Lambdas, cornerstones of Functional Programming.

> **You never need classes in JavaScript**, and I have never seen a situation where class is a better approach than the alternatives. If you can think of any, leave a comment, but I’ve been making that challenge for years now, and *nobody has come up with a good use-case* — just flimsy arguments about micro-optimizations or style preferences.

* Our very own @keccers and @marksb created a [resource list](https://github.com/keccers/resource_list) for front-end development in design, styling, and typography.

### Cross-Browser Testing

* [Cross Browser Testing](http://crossbrowsertesting.com/) - Free with [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) subscription. Tests over 400 browsers
* [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/)
* [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
* [Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/)
* [IE VMs](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms) - Automated Installation of the Microsoft IE App Compat virtual machines (IE Testing). Thanks to [Ryan Spencer](https://twitter.com/ryanjoelspencer), who also says this.

> Microsoft released Windows images just to run versions of IE for developers. IE8 is the newest version that will run on XP so at least grab that. If you want them all, this script does all the installation legwork for you. I installed everything on my Mac and it took up around 50gb, but its so much nicer to work with than browser stack.

* [Android Install](http://www.android-x86.org/). Here's Ryan again.

> I usually test Chrome, Safari, and Firefox in OSX and then check IE10, IE11, and Android Chrome in virtual boxes. You can also use the Chrome extension [Ripple](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc), but that is just for simulating mobile sizing, it doesn't actually match the rendering engine.

## Back-end Developer

Also known as: `Server-Side Engineer`

## Full-stack Engineer

The infamous "full-stack engineer". Google `Full Stack Engineer Dead`, and you come up with a slew of articles that state this type of engineer is non-existent, yet companies are still trying to hire them.

Andy Shore writes "[The Myth of the Full-stack Developer](http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html)"

Written over ten years ago and still absolutely relevant. **Rocket Surgery Made Easy** is a book on how to implement usability tests, i.e. getting a user in front of your product.

> “I’m an X major who wants to be a Data Scientist. Where do I start?”
 
> In this email, we’re sharing 5 important tips that will help you get on the path to Data Science excellence (and some further reading on each topic). If you have your eyes set on the Data Science job market, these tips are crucial.
 
1. **Develop an area of technical analytic expertise**: Start with a solid foundation in statistics. Once you’ve built that, learning Advanced Statistics, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing could come in handy. If you are still in school, take courses in these subjects. If not, develop expertise in any one of these areas, and try to be conversant in a few others.

2. **Build an affinity for code**: No two ways here. Hacking skills might be even more important than formal systems development here. As a entry-level Data Scientist, a lot of your work will be to take lousy data and put it in a form that can be analysed. And it will be different with each data set you work on. Learning Python or R will serve you well.

3. **Learn to tell a story (with data)**:  First, learn basic statistics. Second, be able to express your brilliant analysis in a way that normal people can understand. Your clients and colleagues won’t always understand what terms like “p-value” mean. You need to explain your results well, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that laymen understand. Visualization techniques can be helpful here.

4. **Get a mentor**: A hands-on, project-based approach is best when you’re learning the ropes. You will make some mistakes. Having someone with experience to talk to, review your work, and keep you accountable - it’s easy to stay on track.

5. **Build a strong portfolio**: Building projects is not just the best way to learn, it’s also a great way to showcase the skills you’ve acquired. The best companies will want you to demonstrate that you can work through a data problem end-to-end: from data gathering and cleaning, to analysis and clearly communicating your findings. An effective way to start building portfolio is to enroll in some Data Science competitions.
