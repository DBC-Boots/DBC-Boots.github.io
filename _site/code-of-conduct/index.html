  <article class="post-content">
    <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Thanks for reading through our Code of Conduct. We love our community and don’t want folks hating or thrashing around. This Code of Conduct applies to all of our repositories in this organization.</p>

<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Django community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Django community.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    <ul>
      <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
      <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
      <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
      <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
      <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Repeated harassment of others.</strong> In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Django is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Django comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation</li>
  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
  <li>Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person’s gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>
  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop</li>
  <li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>
  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
  <li>Stalking or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
  <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
  <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse</li>
  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
</ul>

<p>Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
  <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”</li>
  <li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>
  <li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
  <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
</ul>
