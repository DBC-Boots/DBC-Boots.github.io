  Welcome ye all who have found the Post-DBC Resources guide.
  This section are resources to get you started for your Post-DBC life.
  We're using the Wiki instead of contributing to the Repository.
  That way, anyone who joins can make without having to do commits (we're not official here).
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://DBC-Boots.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site

wikiToJekyll:

  # your user Github Name
  user_name: DBC-Boots

  # your repository Name
  repository_name: DBC-Boots.github.io

  # set your remote name. 'origin' is the default name set
  # when you do a 'git init'
  # if you changed this name be sure to change this parameter
  deploy_remote: "origin"

  # for an organization / user, publication branch is master
  # for a project, publication branch is gh-pages
  deploy_branch: "gh-pages"

  # wiki repository url
  # if you live this blank, it will be derived from you code
  # user_name and repository_name
  #   eg : wiki_repository_url = user_name/repository_name/wiki'
  #
  # If you're importing a wiki from another code repository
  # you MUST set this url
  #
  # IMPORTANT: no git@github.com: in front
  #            You MUST use the htpps:// url or it will
  #            cause a submodule error on github
  #
  # Example : https://github.com/userName/repositoryName.wiki.git

  wiki_repository_url: https://github.com/DBC-Boots/Resources.wiki.git

  # wiki submodule folder
  # the underscore makes sure that this folder is ignored by Jekyll
  wiki_source: "_wiki"

  # wiki Jekyll generated pages destination folder
  wiki_dest: "wiki"

  # commit and push to Jekyll repository after wiki synchronisation
  commit_and_push: false
